In this research endeavor, the capabilities of neural networks are utilized to discern regional patterns within a diverse populace via marathon finishing times. Leveraging two decades of race data from both the TCS New York Marathon along with the prestigious Boston Marathon, the study aims to develop a predictive model capable of identifying individuals' geographic origins based on their previous athletic performances. This exploration holds promise in shedding light on the intersection of environmental variables and ultimate race achievements in the realm of marathon running.
